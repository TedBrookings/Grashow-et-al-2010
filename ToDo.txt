Something's up with pyloric fits.  Fix it.

Something's up with clustering and map properties.  Fix it.
  Also: maybe improve clustering algorithm.  Low priority.

Switch from p-values and R^2 to using only reduced chi^2

Maybe remove JackknifeFit, and just do regular fits
  -Faster
  -Simpler
  -No longer necessary with proper multiple-comparisons correction
